# tictactoe-code-exam Introduction

Hi, Applicant!    

Congratulations in passing our initial screening! The next step is to take the code exam. We have prepared this code exam to prove you’re fit for the job. Whether you’re an up-and-coming or an established Senior Software Developer, this code exam will test your skills in Front-End Development and C# Development. Anyone who is great in programming can take this code exam.    

This code exam should not take you more than 6 hours to code. It might even take you less than 4 hours to code, depending on your skill level since we already created the TicTacToe Business Logic for you to investigate and call. No need to create your own TicTacToe Business Logic. So you might ask, what will you program? If you read the PDF instructions, we are asking you to simply create the unit test for the Business Logic and create the presentation layer in Angular. Of course, you also need to study the Business Logic to know how to pass the json payload.    

Thank you for considering the code exam and we look forward to evaluate your source code. Happy Coding!
  
Best Regards,\
CONAN Development Team
