# tictactoe-code-exam

Hi, There!

Thank you for considering our code exam. The purpose of the code exam is to try and find out if you fit our required skills for the Full Stack Software Engineer role. In this repository, we have prepared the TicTacToe Business Logic. Your task are to investigate the payload taken by the TicTacToe API and create an Angular Front-End. You also need to create unit tests for the Business Logic. The Angular Front-End will connect to the TicTacToe Business Logic using the API enpoints. 

Again, thank you for considering our code exam and we look forward to evaluate your source code. Happy coding!







Sincerely,

CONAN Development Team
